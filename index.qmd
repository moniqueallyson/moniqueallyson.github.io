About Me
</h1>
<p>
Hi, welcome to my page! I'm a proud Gaucho, graduating Spring class of 20225 and will be departing with a B.S. in Environmental Studies. I am an advocate for sustainability and currently practice a vegan lifestyle which is integrated into my work through research and creative projects. 

Utilizing both my scientific and humanities background, I combine research with documentaries, poetic writings, and podcast. On my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, reading, cuddling with my dog as well as socializing with my friends and family.
