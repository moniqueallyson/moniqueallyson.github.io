<div class="poem-content">
There are birds in the neighbor's tree,
it's the same tune from last year,
I almost forgot birds could sing,
summer has been too long and quiet,
ever since the gardeners became barbers.

In the heat as the kitchen swelled,
we danced and wrote notes, bouncing ideas, 
listening to the calls of jittery, young babes,
being fed and cared for by their mothers.

Their nest reminded me of a street I've lived on,
a place lined with rows of crying pink trees,
and tall silver walls stuffed with a mixture of families,
a home overfilled with life like a pregnant belly button.

Landlords demand a rent, wrote a letter,
Dear tenants-Evacuate. 
As if homelessness is an alternative.

Birds don't pay rent and neither should you,
on land that is the property of soil and carcass.

You've been too quiet this summer,
it may be time to begin again.
