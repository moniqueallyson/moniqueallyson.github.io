I am an advocate for sustainability and currently practice a vegan lifestyle which is integrated into my work through research and creative projects. Utilizing both my scientific and humanities background, I combine research with documentaries, poetic writings, and podcast. On my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, reading, cuddling with my dog as well as socializing with my friends and family."
