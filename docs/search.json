    "text": "There’s a whole multitude of hobbies, passions, and interests that I hold dearly to my heart. I would love to display it all for everyone, but the three things that create who I am to my core is: Traveling, Veganism, and my dog Raaja.\n\nMy Adventures around the world\nSince I was a kid, traveling has been on my mind. Due to my family originating from parts of Mexico, South Korea, Portugal, and Spain. I have always had a great sense of wanderlust. I wanted to witness the childhood of my mother from Jalisco, Mexico or the lands my grandmother left in South Korea. As of today, I have traveled to four different countries: France, Germany, Switzerland, and (of course) Mexico! Each place was magnetic and beautiful in its own unique way. The way of living is different in each place. My most memorable travel was to Lyon and Paris France for my birthday in 2022. While there, we had the chance to travel to Genevieve, Switzerland which was a large hub of shopping and dinning. The best part about traveling is getting to eat the local food and having a new scenery enter your life for a brief moment.\n\n\n\nLyon, France (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nTulum, Mexico (2025)\n\n\n\n\nMy Vegan Lifestyle\nI wasn’t born into a vegan life; I adopted one. I have always had a great interest in reducing my meat intake, cutting out dairy for health reasons, and just not harming animals in general, but never took the plunge until three years ago. If my teenage self could see me, I wish I could tell her that we did it! People may think it’s just changing the diet, but it’s other things too like not buying fur, wool, or leather. My vegan lifestyle blends very well with my academic interests and I have had the chance to explore environmental veganism due to my major. There are many challenges that come with being vegan as the food may not be so easily accessible such as animal-based food, but with time and experience those challenges have become minimal.\n\n\n\nHomemade and Restaurant\n\n\n\n\nMy dog Raaja\nI am blessed to have amazing friends and family in my life, but having a dog is like having a guardian angel on Earth. Raaja was found deserted in front of a kill shelter for animals in Downey, California on December 1, 2015 which is my birthday. The very next day, wanting a dog out of nowhere, I visited SEACCA and fell immediately in love with a small golden puppy roughly four months old. Unfortunately, there was a long list of people waiting to adopt him. Nonetheless, I add my name to it. The next day I went to visit again and waas told that I was the only one there for him. I was called to know that I was the only one interested in him which meant I get to have him. Paying the small fee, I got to take him home and dubbed him with the name Maharaaja. Ever since then, he has been the best companion in my life. He goes everywhere with me, to the store, to lunch, and sometimes to class too! He is naturally trained and has a bad habit of running away from home. Not So Fun Fact: He was gone for nine months. Actual Fun Fact: He loves flowers and eating chips!\n\n\n\nMaharaaja (2019)"

    "text": "The four excerpts below are from my poetry book titled Bullseye Tiger that I released for a brief moment on Amazon in 2021. I chose to share these because they have elements of nature, environmentalism, and justice — what I’ve studied at UCSB the past two years. These were written before I was vegan; my lifestyle changed in 2022."

Thankfully, I have many passions, interests, hobbies, and dreams to generate multiple projects throughout my years at UCSB.\n\n\nFor my Critical Thinking course (ES 40), we were tasked to do a research project of our choice and interest throughout the entire quarter. As a person who was majoring in environmental studies, I was open to hearing from classmates and other peers about their dietary choices and conflicting environmental beliefs. I did research on the impact that both the agricultural and livestock industry have on the environment and the choices individuals can make to lessen it from their own home. I provided perspectives from different backgrounds, both cultural and economical through personal interviews as to provide insight on the barriers that may be preventing environmentally conscious people from lessening their animal-based choices. I also highlights local resources and aid for those who are seeking to start their own personal journey of reducing their carbon foot-print or just lower their animal-based food intake.\nBelow is my research-based documentary:"
