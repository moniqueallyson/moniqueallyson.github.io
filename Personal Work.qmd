The four excerpts below are from my poetry book titled *Bullseye Tiger* that I released for a brief moment on Amazon in 2021. I chose to share these because they have elements of nature, environmentalism, and justice â€” what I've studied at UCSB the past two years. These were written before I was vegan; my lifestyle changed in 2022.
