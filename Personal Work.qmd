The four excerpts below are from my poetry book titled "Bullseye Tiger" that I released for a brief moment on Amazon for purchase in 2021. I chose to share these because they have elements of nature, environmentalism, and environmental/social justice which is what I have spent studying at UCSB for the past two years These poems each pertain to a part of me that cares deeply for my surrounding and those who inhabit them. Though, these poems were written before I was vegan as my lifestyle didn't change until the year 2022.
