::: poem-content
Water red as a beet, that's never kissed skies, but has kissed animals' feet.

It kisses them with knives, with red lips, thunderous lips, cancerous lips that steal lives.

A bison walks and splashes, ignoring the local vultures, the molding of birds and bats.

Plus, the flamingos, bright pink, frozen and displayed like glass.

There is rope around a neck, and blood stains in the past.

There's blood by their head, as they are stuck in battle, stuck as gum dressed in dread.

Nothing moves or progresses, but the breath of peace, ound in complete stillness.

Shaking off the lake's clay, dusting off the red mineral, just to survive another day.
